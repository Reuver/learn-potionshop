# README

This is my attempt at the potion shop question on https://www.learncpp.com/ 's chapter 17 final quiz.
It probably isn't the cleanest way of doing it, but this is the most complex thing I've done yet, so I am at the limit of my capabilities.

The most important thing I have learned through this project is how to use https://en.cppreference.com to learn how functions work.


I've used LearnCPP's random.h header on this project.
